Predicting students' performance becomes more challenging due to the large volume of data in educational databases. Also, it is an excellent concern to higher education management. The ability to predict the performance tendency of students is critical to improve their teaching, learning process and support the students who are at risk of academic failure.
In this project, we aim to build a student final grades model for the student performance in secondary education (high school) for Math and Portuguese. Using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression to help the learning institutions use the final grades to evaluate the student performance.
